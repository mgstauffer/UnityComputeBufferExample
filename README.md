# Compute Buffer Example

This is a simple example Unity project of how to use a compute buffer in a vertex-fragment shader, as opposed to in a compute shader.

Load and run the `computebuffertest` scene and change the `Scaling Vector` values in the `Main` scene object.

See the comments in the code for guidance.
